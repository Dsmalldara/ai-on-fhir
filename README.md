# Security & HIPAA Compliance Plan
## AI on FHIR Query Interface

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### SMART on FHIR Implementation
- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization**: Implementing SMART on FHIR authorization framework for secure authentication with EHR systems
- **Token Management**: Use short-lived access tokens (15-30 min) with refresh tokens stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies also storing access token in-memory to for added security
- **Scopes**:   principle of least privilege should be followed
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforcing MFA for all user accounts, especially administrative access

### Session Security
- Implement secure session management with automatic timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Use encrypted session tokens with cryptographic signatures to prevent tampering
- Rotate session IDs after authentication and privilege escalation

---

## 2. Data Privacy & Protection

### Encryption
- **Data in Transit**: Enforce TLS 1.3+ for all API communications with certificate pinning
- **Data at Rest**: Encrypt all PHI using AES-256 encryption in database and file storage
- **Key Management**: Use AWS KMS or  Azure Key Vault for secure key rotation and management

### Data Minimization
- Query results return only necessary patient data fields required for the specific use case
- Implement data masking for sensitive fields (e.g., SSN, full dates of birth) based on user roles for confidentiality purposes
- Temporary query results should be purged after 24 hours

### De-identification
- Support de-identified data queries for research and analytics purposes
- Follow HIPAA Safe Harbor or Expert Determination methods for de-identification
- Maintain separation between identified and de-identified datasets

---

## 3. Audit Logging Strategy

### Comprehensive Logging
- **Access Logs**: Record all PHI access attempts (successful and failed) with:
  - User identity and role
  - Timestamp (with timezone)
  - Resource accessed (patient ID, query text)
  - Action performed (read, search, filter)
  - IP address and user agent
  - Session ID

### Log Security
- Store audit logs in immutable, append-only storage (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, )
- Encrypt logs both in transit and at rest
- Retain logs for minimum 6 years per HIPAA requirements
- Implement automated log analysis for anomaly detection (unusual access patterns, bulk data exports)

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time alerts for suspicious activities:
  - Multiple failed authentication attempts
  - Access to large volumes of patient records
  - After-hours access by non-emergency personnel
  - Access from unusual geographic locations

---

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Role Hierarchy
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, audit log review
- **Physician**: Query patient data, view all clinical information
- **Nurse**: Query patients under their care, limited diagnosis access
- **Researcher**: Access only to de-identified aggregate data
- **Billing**: Access to demographic and insurance data only



## 5. Additional Security Measures

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and prompt injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limits (100 requests/hour per user) to prevent data scraping
- **CORS Policy**: Restrict API access to whitelisted frontend domains only
- **Security Headers**: Implement CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and other security headers

### Infrastructure Security
- Deploy application in HIPAA-compliant cloud environments (AWS HIPAA, Azure Healthcare, GCP Assured Workloads)
- Use Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic
- Implement network segmentation and private subnets for database access
- Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing (quarterly)

### Incident Response
- Establishing breach notification procedures per HIPAA (60-day notification requirement)
- Maintaining incident response playbook with clear escalation paths
- Conduct annual security training for all system users
- Perform regular disaster recovery and backup testing 

### Business Associate Agreements (BAA)
- Execute BAAs with all third-party service providers handling PHI
- Ensure cloud providers, monitoring services, and analytics tools are HIPAA-compliant
- Document data processing agreements and subprocessor relationships

---

## 6. Compliance Documentation

### Required Documentation
- There should be Security Risk Analysis (annual updates)
- Policies and Procedures manual
- Workforce training records
- System access logs and audit reports
- Incident response documentation

### Regular Audits
- Conduct quarterly internal security audits
- Annual third-party HIPAA compliance assessment preferably by independent parties
- Continuous monitoring of NIST, HITRUST, and HIPAA regulatory updates for changes and to ensure strict following of guidelines
